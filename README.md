Here's to the new readme of the project!

==========================
  WHAT HAS BEEN FIXED:
==========================

• Fixed broken links and implemented proper linking from the nav bar to the correct page element.

• Implemented alt text to each and every image on the page

• Reduced some of the background images size for improved load times (Though it is still rather large, and probably could have been reduced further)

• Implemented semantic html elements to help improve readability for back end developers

• Commented out html page for improved readability

• Commented css page for developer readability and ease of navigation

• Implemented a proper tab title
